## Acknowledgments

The course material would not be possible without the prior work of many others. In particular we would like to acknowledge:

- Simon Farrell, John Kruschke, Ben Lambert, Stephan Lewandowsky, Michael Lee, Richard McElreath, and Eric-Jan Wagenmakers for their excellent textbooks which have heavily shaped the course content and structure
- Woo-Young Ahn, Nate Haines, Jan Gläscher and Antonius Wiehler for their support in developing the initial version of these materials

## Future content

We are hoping to further expand the content covered in this course. Examples for additional workshops include: 

- Applying a wider family of computational models (delay discounting, intertemporal choice)
- Computational modeling of decision-making tasks using the [`hBayesDM`](https://ccs-lab.github.io/hBayesDM/index.html) package[^1] in `R` 
- Practical examples of implementing model-based fMRI
