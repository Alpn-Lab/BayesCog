This website[^1] is an adapted version of teaching materials originally made for the <ins>award winning</ins>\* **BayesCog** seminar at the [Faculty of Psychology](https://psychologie.univie.ac.at/), [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/en/), as part of the Advanced Seminar for master's students (Mind and Brain track; recorded during Summer Term 2020/2021).
Further content from the [BayesCog workshop at UKE Hamburg](https://github.com/lei-zhang/BayesCog_Part1) (2023) have also been added. 

**Recording**: Recordings from the original version of the course are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RpLF7ufZs4&list=PLfRTb2z8k2x9gNBypgMIj3oNLF8lqM44-).
The most recent recording from the 2021 summer semester is also available on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfRTb2z8k2x8ZCqDJ0WEFNs2ymXQCliLa).

**Outreach**: [**Twitter thread**](https://twitter.com/lei_zhang_lz/status/1276506555660275714?s=20) (being **liked 700+ times** on Twitter) summarizing the contents of the course. 

**Award/Recognition**: The original course received a commendation award from the [Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS)](https://improvingpsych.org/mission/awards/) (also see a [tweet](https://twitter.com/improvingpsych/status/1323269273033281538?s=20)), as well as an ECR Teaching Award from the [Faculty of Psychology, University of Vienna](https://ecr-psychology.univie.ac.at/news/).

## Course summary

Computational modeling and mathematical modeling provide an insightful quantitative framework that allows researchers to inspect latent processes and to understand hidden mechanisms. Hence, computational modeling has gained increasing attention in many areas of cognitive science through **cognitive modeling**. One illustration of this trend is the growing popularity of Bayesian approaches to cognitive modeling. To this end, this course teaches the theoretical and practical knowledge necessary to perform, evaluate and interpret Bayesian modeling analyses, with a specific emphasis towards modeling latent cognitive processes. 

In the course, students will be formally grounded in key principles of cognitive modeling including Bayesian statistics, statistical distibrutions and reinforcement learning. 
We will use [R/RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and a newly developed statistical computing language - [Stan](mc-stan.org) - to perform Bayesian analyses, ranging from simple binomial models and linear regression models to more complex hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) models.

## Setup

The course requires minimal set-up, however requires specific software:

1. Install the latest version of `R` [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and RStudio [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

2. Install and set-up the latest version of RStan [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started)

Then:

3. Clone the repository and change directory into the project root:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BayesCog.git
cd BayesCog
```

4. Install the relevant `R` packages using `renv`

Open `R` in the project directory (`BayesCog.Rproj`) and run:

```r
source("setup.R")
```

After running this command once, the project environment will load automatically whenever you open the project.
